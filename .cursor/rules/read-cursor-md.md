# Always Read cursor.md First

**When starting ANY new task**, always read `@cursor.md` first to understand:
- Critical project rules (package manager, AI provider, environment)
- Tech stack and architecture essentials
- Common modification patterns

This prevents mistakes and reduces exploration time.
